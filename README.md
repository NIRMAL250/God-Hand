<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46397556/166101661-1a67b6ac-f516-4d2e-83c3-97bbe2c13d8d.png)

God's Hand is an application developed using React.js and Circle API.

Helping hands who save even a single life is termed "God's Hand".
 
God's Hand is an International crowdfunding application for social good. People who can't afford to pay bills for the treatment of their loved ones can request funds from the application. This application is not limited to specific countries so that people can receive funds from all over the world. 

The cool thing about this application is that it enables people to receive funds for problems other than with human beings, that is you can take funds for helping abandoned and ill animals and the environment.

The donors can also receive funds if any need occurs. This application will connect the world by helping each other. So we get a better and healthier world.

So how does it receive funds internationally? The answer is using circle API. People can share funds from their country's bank account either by using credit cards or traditional mode or by using blockchain for cryptocurrency. The currency is then stored as USDC. People can raise and receive funds by converting USDC to their country's currency.
